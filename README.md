# treasure-of-pharaos
OpenGL game.

Treasure of Pharaos is a two-level 3D maze game made using OpenGL. The main goal in every level is to find the pharaonic monument to proceed to the next level. Level 2 is harder than level 1. In level 2, everytime you collect a coin, it becomes brighter and easier to navigate throught the maze. You can navigate throught the game using arrow WASD & right click. You can have first person view when you click on '1' on the keyboard, and third person view when you click on '3'.

To start the game, download the zip file and open the solution file in visual studio, then run it and enjoy!
