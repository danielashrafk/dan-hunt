# Treasure of Pharaos (OpenGL)

Treasure of Pharaos is a two-level 3D maze game made using OpenGL. The main goal in every level is to find the pharaonic monument before to proceed to the next level. Level 2 is harder than level 1. In every level when you collect a coin your score increases by 5. In level 2, everytime you collect a coin it becomes brighter and easier to navigate through the maze too. You need to find the two mouments without exceeding the time limit. You can navigate throught the game using arrow WASD & right click. You can have first person view when you click on '1' on the keyboard, and third person view when you click on '3'.

To start the game, download the zip file and open the solution file in visual studio, then run it and enjoy (you must have OpenGL installed on your system)!
